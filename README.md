# Drag and Drop

A beginner-friendly JavaScript project that demonstrates how to drag list items and drop them between two containers. This project helps in understanding drag-and-drop events, DOM manipulation, and interactive UI behavior using vanilla JavaScript.

## Features
- Drag list items from one box to another
- Drop items back to the original container
- Visual separation using dashed borders
- Smooth and interactive user experience
- Built using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## How It Works
- Each list item is marked as draggable using the `draggable="true"` attribute.
- JavaScript listens for `dragstart`, `dragover`, and `drop` events.
- Items are moved between containers using `appendChild()`.

## How to Use
1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Click and drag any list item.
3. Drop it into the other container.
4. You can move items back and forth freely.

## What I Learned
- How HTML drag-and-drop works
- Using `dragstart`, `dragover`, and `drop` events
- Preventing default behavior with `e.preventDefault()`
- Moving elements in the DOM using JavaScript
- Building interactive features with small projects

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (Vanilla JS)
